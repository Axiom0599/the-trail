Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):
No, we have built avionics and flight computers for rockets before. And have a ton of experience with IMU and active guidance control for rockets. We have also built autonomous fixed-wing
planes using the Ardu-Pilot platform.

What are you making?
	                                                                      Introducing the Light Bank 
Light Bank power bank that can recharge through solar energy along with USB. We will provide it, which will be strapped on the hiker's backpacks and be connected to a power bank which will
be stored inside the backpack for temperature control purposes. We will be using several hooks to make carrying the battery accessible for the hiker based on weather and personal 
conditions which will be 3d printed for little to no cost. Although others in the trail are also interested in making a power bank, our power bank will offer the ability to recharge when 
needed and will be the size similar to a pocket deodorant which will likely be able to charge a phone fully once however due to its compact size we can build strong 3d printed enclosures 
and also plan to certify it as waterproof with necessary rubber seals and obviously with rigorous testing and validation. With this power bank safety is our utmost priority 

Inspiration:

We were inspired to do this project because of a hike that we went together on. When we were camping we bought a very large power bank with a capacity of 20,000 mah along with both our 
phones charged fully. While we were sleeping we left our phones plugged in and our flashlights on which led to the phone battery depleting along with the power bank which left us 16% on 
one phone the next day. With no way to charge and no potential way to access our hike info online, we made our way back to the starting point and canceled the hike. We hope to provide and
embrace hiker safety with our power bank that can charge off the grid using solar so in the worst emergencies we hope this light will guide and protect the hikers through means of our 
power bank. Hence we named it the light bank, it charges through the sunâ€™s light and is also lightweight.
