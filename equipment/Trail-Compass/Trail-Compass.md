Yes
# What you are making?
We are makeing a digital compass for navigation
# Inspiration:
Our idea was origanaly to have a list of waypoints that the compass could guide us to, simalar to waypoint guides in games. However implementing GPS became too chalanging so the idea was watered down to a simple digital compass
