# Game Cube

**Team Members (1-4 suggested): @magic-frogg and maybe some others**

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good): Yes**

**What you are making? A small-ish cube with screens (maybe touchscreen), buttons, and knobs. People will be able to play games on it that involve communicating to other people. The cube will have Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa or something similar to connect to other cubes to form a local area network. There will be some games avaiable to play with other people, such as Orpheus-themed Amongus, Mafia, Spyfall, card games, or like Pokemon Go, or one big game. It would also have a solar-powered battery.**

**Inspiration: I think it'd be really cool to have a cube that you can play games with everyone else without celluar service.**

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works): They don't exist yet.**
