Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good): Yes

What you are making? An alarm which will sound if you fall. It will alert the other campers if you are clumbsy and need assistance. Hopefully I can use an MPU6050 with this [Kaluma](https://github.com/niklauslee/mpu6050) library I found.

Inspiration: Apple Watch SE fall detection!

Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):
