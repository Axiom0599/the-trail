**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
This is our first time building a big PCB project (we've built a couple small ones)! It's going to be a wild adventure. We look forward to figuring it out with everyone else on the Slack!

**What you are making?**
Have you ever been hiking? Dieter & I have hiked many times. When it gets dark, it becomes hard to know where you are & almost impossible to take a photo. 

We're making a night-vision camera! You'll be able to take photos and put them on an SD Card.

**Inspiration:**
We recently made a VR Game where the user can take photos of Capybaras and have those photos sent to their phone. I found the interaction between tapping a button and having that photo magically float over to a phone to be super magical. 

Dieter is also a bit of a photographer / videographer of sorts, so why not create a project that can allow us to take a new type of photo! (night-vision photos)

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
