Project name: Flaura Fauna recognition camera

Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good: Yeah it is :)

What you are making?
It's like a camera but you don't take pictures. You capture an image of a bird or plant instead, and it will recognize the type of bird/plant for you and display it on an lcd screen.

Inspiration: I came up with this by myself and because I've used image recognition in projects before

Sketches (if they exist) (paper works): Still in progress
