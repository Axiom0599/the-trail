Is this your first PCB rodeo (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good)
Making PCB is basically a daily task for me, my electronic-related projects demand me to create a PCB. Although daily being said, I've never created a double-sided PCB due to my manufacturing capability and the time that would've been taken to order one online. Whether it is personal projects or business and school-related projects I've created both simple and complicated PCB designs over 5 years. It's been very fun and intriguing, couldn't wait for this project!

What you are making
I've been brainstorming all day, figuring out what would be functional, fun, memorable, and haven't existed yet.
It's the memory bank! Well, a memory bank is essentially an exclusive power bank that will carry a remembrance significance to the owner at and after the event ends. 
At the event, it can see other online participants and send them simple messages such as You got this! or Have fun on the hike!. There are also a few other functionalities like flashlights, minigames, and electronic identification cards to make friends along the way easier simply by touching pogo pins together, and you can even customize your own identification card!
After the event is done, the memory bank becomes an electronic yearbook for the event. You can see all the participants and transmit them a hello, and at the receiver side if the device is active there would be a led notification.
The power bank side of things itself uses replaceable 18650 batteries for quick swaps and reliability.

Inspiration
At first, I figured that I would like to make something that is both functional and leaves a memorable memory for the user about this trip. I've had thoughts about cameras and GPS but then it'll defeat the function of smartphones. So I went from there and thought about other memory forms that could be captured at the event. After hours of brainstorming, I went for a power bank which was already readily available on the markets. So I thought why not invent some new features, such as an electronic yearbook and a simple communication method to say simple stuff like hey or good morning with one click embedded on the power bank.
