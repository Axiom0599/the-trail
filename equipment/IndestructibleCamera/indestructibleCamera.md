# Indestructible Camera

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):** MTubeYT (Open to more!)

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):** I've built a simple button-LED PCB before.

**What you are making?** A very strong camera with a display and capabilities to shoot pictures, that can handle harsh conditions (like that ones we'll experience in on The Trail!)

**Inspiration:** This video on YouTube about the indestructible Nokia phone seemed very interesting to me: {https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9zRrPwARlIs}

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):** None yet, but coming hopefully soon!
