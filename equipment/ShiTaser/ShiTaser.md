# Your Project Name

**Team Members (1-4 suggested):** Alex Luo

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):** Yes

**What you are making?**
As someone whose longest hike is from my car to the grocery store, I'm quite concerned about the privacy of shitting during a group hike. Therefore, I will distribute slick looking cards to everyone under the mysterious pretense that they are purely for cool and innocent purposes.

Little do my victims know, they will be hurt and possibly severely injured and hospitalized immediately upon entering my no-no zone, approximately 25 meters from wherever I choose too alleviate my bowels.

In the event that I decide that I'm too dangerous for the people around me or realize that I don't actually know how to build a taser, I'll resort to a haptic/visual/audio indicator instead.

**Inspiration:**
Michael Reeves

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
