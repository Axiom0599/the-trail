**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):**
Yes, but we do have experience with similar types of hardware projects, like Winter Hardware.

**What you are making?**
A bracelet-style wearable fitness tracker. The tracker would accurately track steps, distance, heart rate, and calories burned during hikes (and possibly more). It would also provide real-time fitness data on a display for use on the trail.

**Inspiration:**
Garmin watches, fitbits, and other similar types of fitness trackers.

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
None so far.
