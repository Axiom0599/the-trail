Your Project Name: MistMate Mosquito Repulsion System (place holder)
Team Members (1-4 suggested): @Ivan Jehad 

Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good): Yes :( but not gonna be my last :)

What you are making?
In all essence a mosquito-repelling device, I haven't finalized the method for how it will function but currently,
I'm leaning towards blowing air through a pyrethrum (natural repelling agent from chrysanthemum flowers) 
soaked pad or heating this pad and directly vapourising the agent into the air 
(ik it sounds like I'm about to turn the trail into a chemical warzone but trust me it's safe, it's used in organic agriculture and by companies that make the less janky version of my idea)
Alternatively, I could build something that uses essential oils, it's just they aren't nearly as effective.

Inspiration: I just hate mosquitos and the first thing I considered for the trail was the mosquitos, so I kind of just want to avoid this problem my own way. 
Devices like this already exist on the market, such as the Thermacell mosquito repeller and it just dawned upon me that I have to build something like this. 

Sketches (if they exist) (paper works): Not currently but within the next few days there should be
