**Team Members (1-4 suggested):** Myself, contact me if you interested in joining :) 

**Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):** 
Yes, I have been learning about electronics for the past few months and really wanted to do a PCB project. I have made a LOT of robots including one this year who is very dependent on a breadboard. 

**What you are making?** 
The headset allows users to navigate, identify plants, look up crucial information, avoid stray branches at night, and more. It's a combination of an Apple Vision Pro and an Alexa thats designed for hiking. It's like a second (or third) pair
of eyes. The rationale for having a 100% audio-based output (no screen) is that screens are expensive, heavy, and distracting during hiking. 

**Inspiration:**
The Apple Vision Pro because it looks so cool. 

**Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):**
